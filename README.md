# Introduction
This project is designed to provide a detailed starting point for time series forecasting initiatives. It includes or will include data preprocessing, log/BoxCox transformations, a train/test split, visualizations, forecasting options, and evaluation options.

There's also a RAG bot having the time series modules and files related to itself in its context. It has short term memory to remember the context of the ongoing conversation. [ADD INSTRUCTIONS ON ACTIVATION AND QUITTING HERE. ALSO MENTION THE SAME FOR AIDER.]
